## Jargon

|------|-------|---------------|
|Radioactive objects|From Peter B.: "It goes back to a Z39.50 project at U of North Texas a decade ago, when we were all trying to get federated search working across everyone's catalogues. The idea was we'd all ingest these records that populated every possible field with predictable unique values, so that you could see whose catalogues retrieved what in response to a query. The metaphor was from radioactive traces on medicine injections. We revived the idea to help with the triplestore testing."|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc111002/m1/2/|
